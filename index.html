                    We are the Squirrels of Presidents Hall. 
                    We love our lives here at the University of Alabama but we want to expand our horizons to other universities. 
                    We specialize in eating unsalted peanuts and have been known to eat from students hands. 
                    We think our skills can help many find joy on campus, and we want more peanuts.

                <!--this should be larger and to the right of the squirrel photo-->
                <p>Google Search defines us as the following:</p>
                <em><p>A <dfn id="def-Squirrel">squirrel</dfn> is an agile tree-dwelling rodent with a bushy tail, 
                    typically feeding on nuts and seeds.</p></em>
                <p>But we like to think of ourselves as more than cute, bushy tailed, nut-loving rodents. We live active lives.
                    We participate in our community, and ultimatly we hope to make a difference on our campus.
                    The University of Alabama has given a home to us for many years, and it is our mission now to spread out Squirrelliness
                    to more campuses.
